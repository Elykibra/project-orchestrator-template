```yaml
project: Code_Analyzer
timestamp: '[SET CURRENT DATETIME]'
type: checkpoint
summary: Initial scaffolding and definition of the core data ingestion structure.
context:
  goal: Create the necessary configuration files and define the Git Diff Parser's input/output structure.
  previous_checkpoint_summary: N/A (Project Initialization)
decisions:
- The initial language supported will be Python 3.
- All configuration will be stored in a project-specific YAML file.
- The Git Diff Parser will output a list of line-by-line code changes.
next_steps:
- Create the 'code_analyzer_config.yaml' file for the Configuration Manager module.
- Define the class structure for the Git_Diff_Parser module in 'git_parser.py'.
- Write the initial function that reads a sample '.diff' file and prints the output structure to the console.
- Run the 'new' command when the parser's structure is defined.
