summary: "Setup of GitHub repository, creation of base file structure, boilerplate, and core configuration files (Phase I)."

context:
  goal: "Initialize the GitHub repository, set up the base file structure, and create the essential project files (Brain, Checkpoint 1)."

decisions:
  - "The main automation script will be named 'checkpoint.py'."
  - "The project directory structure will separate brains from logs (e.g., 'brains/' and 'logs/')."
  - "The core Mother AI definition files will be included in this template."

next_steps:
  - "Initialize a new GitHub repository named 'project-orchestrator-template'."
  - "Create the initial file structure: /brains, /logs, and checkpoint.py (empty)."
  - "Add the generated 'project_orchestrator.brain.v1.json' and '2025-10-02-orchestrator-checkpoint-1.yaml' to the new repo."
  - "Draft the initial README.md, explaining the Mother AI workflow system."
