type: checkpoint
summary: Transformed the GUI into a mini-IDE by adding a file explorer, console, history
  viewer, and a seamless review/finalize modal.
context:
  previous_checkpoint_summary: Developed and integrated a full-featured Tkinter GUI,
    including implementing the core checkpoint creation and finalization workflow.
  previous_next_steps_completed:
  - Implement a "Console Output" view to display messages from checkpoint.py.
  - Add a new section or tab for the 'revert' checkpoint functionality.
  - Refine UI to provide more detailed feedback after actions (e.g., show new checkpoint
    index after finalization).
  - Add validation to prevent creating a new draft if one already exists for the project.
  next_goal: Achieve full CLI feature parity and refine the user experience based
    on initial usage and feedback.
decisions:
- '- Decided to integrate all major UX features (console, file tree, history, modal)
  at once to create a complete, unified user experience rather than incremental, disjointed
  updates.'
next_steps:
- Implement the 'revert' checkpoint functionality, likely as a button in the History
  view.
- Add a feature to open a selected file from the directory tree in the default system
  editor.
- Enhance error handling to provide more specific feedback in the console for Git
  failures.
- Implement state persistence to remember the last selected project on startup.
