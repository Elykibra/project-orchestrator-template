  previous_checkpoint_summary: 'The project has successfully completed the initial
    scoping phase. The architecture has been refined to eliminate external dependencies
    by migrating the PostgreSQL database inside the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
    environment. The deployment model now centers on a single, self-contained OCI
    Always Free Compute VM (likely Ampere A1) that will host both the Python Discord
    bot and its dedicated PostgreSQL instance.


    This architectural decision ensures true 24/7 free uptime by consolidating all
    resources onto the free tier allowance and greatly simplifies network security
    by allowing the bot to connect to the database via localhost.


    The immediate next steps are focused on execution: provisioning the OCI VM, creating
    a local backup of the existing PostgreSQL data (pg_dump), and transferring/restoring
    that data onto the new cloud-based database.'
  previous_next_steps_completed:
  - Log into the OCI Console and **Provision the Always Free Compute VM** (Ampere
    A1 recommended). Ensure you download the SSH Private Key.
  - On your **local machine**, execute `pg_dump` using pgAdmin 4 or the command line
    to create a single, compressed backup file of the existing database (e.g., `bot_data.dump`).
  - Use **SSH (or SFTP)** to securely connect to the new OCI VM and **Transfer the
    `bot_data.dump` file** from your local machine to the VM's home directory.
  - On the **OCI VM**, install the PostgreSQL server package (e.g., `sudo apt install
    postgresql-server`), initialize a new database, and create a user account for
    the bot.
  - On the **OCI VM**, use the `psql` utility to **Restore the data** from `bot_data.dump`
    into the newly created database.
