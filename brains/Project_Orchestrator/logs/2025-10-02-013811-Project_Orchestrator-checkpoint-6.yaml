project: Project_Orchestrator
timestamp: '2025-10-02T01:38:11.679088'
type: checkpoint
summary: Developed and integrated a full-featured Tkinter GUI, including implementing
  the core checkpoint creation and finalization workflow.
context:
  previous_checkpoint_summary: Verified and finalized the complete checkpoint workflow,
    including implementing the update action to automatically rename draft files and
    update the Orchestrator State file for correct context tracking.
  previous_next_steps_completed:
  - Integrate the create_project logic behind the "Scaffold NEW Project" button, ensuring
    the GUI can accept the project name and AI design content.
  - Connect the "Commit & Push Changes" button to the commit_changes function and
    provide user feedback on Git status.
  - Design and connect the Create New Checkpoint button to the create_new_checkpoint
    function, possibly replacing the need for the CLI.
  next_goal: Enhance the GUI with real-time feedback and add remaining core functionalities
    from the CLI to achieve feature parity.
decisions:
  - Chose Tkinter with the ttkthemes library to rapidly develop a cross-platform desktop GUI with a modern aesthetic.
next_steps:
- Implement a "Console Output" view to display messages from checkpoint.py.
- Add a new section or tab for the 'revert' checkpoint functionality.
- Refine UI to provide more detailed feedback after actions (e.g., show new checkpoint
  index after finalization).
- Add validation to prevent creating a new draft if one already exists for the project.
