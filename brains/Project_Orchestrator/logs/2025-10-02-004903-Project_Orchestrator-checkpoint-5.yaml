type: checkpoint
summary: Verified and finalized the complete checkpoint workflow, including implementing
  the update action to automatically rename draft files and update the Orchestrator
  State file for correct context tracking.
context:
  previous_checkpoint_summary: Implemented and successfully tested the core Git logic
    (add, commit, push) in checkpoint.py which dynamically pulls the commit message
    from the latest log file.
  previous_next_steps_completed:
  - Design and implement the new CreateProjectFrame in the GUI to handle file uploads
    and project data.
  - Connect the new action (create_new_checkpoint) to the corresponding GUI button.
  - Implement a reliable status bar or popup system for user feedback on successful
    actions and critical errors.
  next_goal: Fully implement the remaining GUI functionality, connecting the 'Create
    New Project' and 'Commit & Push Changes' buttons to the core logic in checkpoint.py.
decisions: []
next_steps:
- Integrate the create_project logic behind the "Scaffold NEW Project" button, ensuring
  the GUI can accept the project name and AI design content.
- Connect the "Commit & Push Changes" button to the commit_changes function and provide
  user feedback on Git status.
- Design and connect the Create New Checkpoint button to the create_new_checkpoint
  function, possibly replacing the need for the CLI.
